The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program using UNIX signals.

### create a communication program in the form of a client and a server.<br>

• The server must be started first. After its launch, it has to print its PID.<br>
• The client takes two parameters: ◦ The server PID.<br>
• The string to send.<br>
• The client must send the string passed as a parameter to the server.<br>

### Once the string has been received, the server must print it.<br>
• The server has to display the string pretty quickly. Quickly means that if you think it takes too long, then it is probably too long.
# Sending and Intercepting a Signal in C
## What is a Signal?
A signal is a standardized notification message used in Unix and POSIX-compliant operating systems. It is asynchronously sent to a running program to notify it of some event. The system interrupts the process’ normal execution to trigger a specific reaction like, among other things, terminating it. So signals are a sort of inter-process communication.
